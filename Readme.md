For technical instruction and for guide to create a Google account and a project with Google Cloud Vision API, please refer to this blog.
If you followed the guide and everything went as planned, you should now have a text file containing a line-by-line transcription of all the machine-readable content in your PDF.

Here's a side-by-side comparison of some of my results.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Resume</td>
     <td>WordCloud</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="static/Software-Engineering-Resume-Sample-compressed-1.png" width=450 height=460></td>
    <td><img src="static/wordcloud-software.png " width=450 height=460></td>

 </table>
